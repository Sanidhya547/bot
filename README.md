# bot

This is an initial phase of our chatbot for which we have used the RASA framework.

This chatbot answers some basic questions about like what are stocks, stock market etc and for the remaining definitions, for eg: if the user asks that he/she wants to know about the definition of other finance related terms, the chatbot sends the user the link of a dictionary that contains the meaning of all the terms related to finance.

We are now working on the API integration part where the chatbot can search the web and answer questions accordingly. We are plannig to use Yahoo finance API which is free and easily available on the web.
